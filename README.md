Hello, good morning to all those interested in creating your own Lineal Regression Model.
This proyect is based solely in gaining a deep understanding of the mathematics behind Lineal Regreession Models, so many explanations are centered more on the math aspect than at the programming aspect.

If you want to contribute, please go ahead and:
-send me a message explaining what part maight need improvement
-any coding or math ideas that may lead to better understandment

Note that any changes made by contributing will appear on the main coding section as a "Explanation by user" or "Code by user", and may appear in this same README file

THANKS TO:
